Welcome to Bridgetown!


This is a test site to get used to the work flow of putting a Bridgetown Application up onto GitHub and from there onto Netlify.


The [repo for this site](https://github.com/CuriousPhysicist/bridgetown_tailwind_ach) is public, so feel free to take a look. It lean on a [tutorial for integating TailwindCSS](https://dev.to/andrewmcodes/build-and-deploy-a-static-site-with-ruby-bridgetown-tailwindcss-and-netlify-3934) by Andrew Mason, though I had to tweek things slightly as the file structure for the current version of Bridgetown has moved away slightly from its Jeckyll roots. Rather than having `src/_includes/` as the location for partials it now uses `src/_layouts/` which is a slightly more Ruby-on-Rails feel to the naming and suits me fine as I'm a RoR developer. :-)
